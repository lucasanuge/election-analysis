# Analysis of the Election Audit

## Overview of Election Audit
The purpose of the election analysis audit was to help Seth and Tom to find additional information requested by the election commission by analyzing the given data set. We have been given a starter code to find the candidates, the total vote count, each candidate's vote count, and the winner of the election. However, the election commission wanted additional analysis on the counties and requested us to find the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county, and the county with the highest turnout. In addition to that, we were also requested to save our results on the **election_analysis.txt** file.
